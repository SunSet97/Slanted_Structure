There is no setup required, all you need to do is drag and drop the prefabs into your project! You will find them under the "FallingLeaves" folder. In this folder you will see the three categories which depict the three visual states of the leaves: Summer (green/lively), Fall (orange/red/yellow), and Winter/Dead (brown/black). Each category has the same sub-categories, as follows:

•Calm: Leaves are slowly raining straight down, origin of prefab to be placed on the underside of a tree, or to be greatly widened and placed in the sky for cool forest/nature ambient effects.

•Windy: Same as "Calm" but the leaves are slowly being blown toward the local X-axis, meaning wherever the RED ARROW is pointing when translating/rotating the prefab, is where the leaves will blow. You can easily change the direction by simply rotating the prefab--as they all move locally--to match the wind direction in your project!

•Stormy: Same as "Windy" but the leaves are being blown very strongly towards the X-axis. You can change the direction of the wind on the leaves in the same manner as you do with "Windy": simply rotate the prefab.

•Ambience: Meant to be used on a larger scale for an ambient "floating particle" effect. The leaves are very floaty, slightly falling towards the ground, but mostly blowing lightly to the side (along the X-axis once again). Rotate the prefab to change the direction of the leaves. This VFX is meant to be used much like a large "Calm" prefab would be used: to create an ambience feel in a forest or nature scene.


Under each one of these you will see a folder titled "LEAVES STAY ON GROUND" and three prefabs, with suffixes "HEAVY", "LIGHT", and "MEDIUM". These are the densities of the prefabs: HEAVY will contain a high amount of leaves and have a thicker feel to it, while LIGHT will contain much less leaves and have a thinner feel, while MEDIUM is in-between. These first prefabs you see behave in a manner where the leaves will despawn once they collide with something. Under the "LEAVES STAY ON GROUND" folder, you will find three more prefabs. These prefabs are the exact same except the leaves will lay on the ground for a few seconds before fading out after colliding with something. (!!!) These only work for flat grounds, as they lay horizontally, thus THESE ARE NOT RECOMMENDED IN AREAS WHERE THE LEAF PARTICLES WILL COLLIDE WITH VERTICAL OR SLANTED SURFACES. (!!!) However, in a decently-flat-grounded forest scene, these will work great! (Notice the LEAVES STAY ON GROUND prefabs will be slightly more intensive on your project, as they contain an extra handful of particles at all times).

There is a LIGHT, MEDIUM, and HEAVY prefab for every different behavior, and same goes for each sub-category's LEAVES STAY ON GROUND prefabs.

The demo scene is under BryceMacDonald-FallingLeavesPack > "Scenes". This scene has a few example prefabs placed with altered dimensions and rotations, and a variety of the visuals and behaviors you can find within the "FallingLeaves" folder and subsequent subfolders. This is all just for demonstration purposes to give you an idea of what this VFX pack has to offer! Simply hit "Play" and check out the Game window to see the set-up camera's viewpoint of the demonstration!

General knowledge of the Shuriken Particle System is helpful in using these VFX, but not necessary. The one thing you will need to know how to do is change the size/shape of the VFX. To do so: 

•After placing a VFX in-editor, click the little arrow for a dropdown of the three VFX under each prefab (2 VFX for "Ambience" prefabs) 
•It's best to select all three(two) of these if you're using a version of Unity that allows you to do so, and then go to the second tab under the inspector: "Shape"
•From here the "Shape" drop-down menu has different options to change shape (if you would like to rotate the shape, simply rotate the prefab)
•All of these VFX will almost always use the "Box" shape, which is currently what they're all on
•"Sphere" may work for some trees if you want more volume to the VFX 
•After selecting "Box" or "Sphere", feel free to change the numbers in the "Shape X", "Shape Y", and "Shape Z" values below the dropdown menu
•These values will change the dimensions of the shape to fit the desired location in your scene
•IT'S BEST TO CHANGE VFX SIZES THIS WAY, AS SIMPLY SCALING THE PREFAB WILL BREAK THE BEHAVIOR OF THE VFX IN MOST CASES
